            <p>
            <p><b>1933</b> Eunice Kathleen Waymon, later known as Nina Simone, was born in Tryon, North Carolina.
              <br><br>
              <b>1936</b> At the age of three or four she began to play the piano. Her mother was a preacher, and Eunice would play the piano for revival meetings, which she later described as “some of my most fantastic experiences”.
              <br><br>
              <b>1938</b> She began lessons with classical piano tutor, Miss Mazzanovich. Lessons were funded by one of her mother’s white colleagues, and to attend classes Eunice had to cross the railway tracks which separated the white and black parts of town. These lessons sparked a lifelong appreciation of Johann Sebastian Bach, Chopin, Brahms, Beethoven and Schubert.
              <br><br>
              <b>1944</b> At a piano recital where her parents were made to stand at the back, whilst white people sat and watched, Eunice refused to play until her parents were allowed to sit at the front.
              <br><br>
              <b>1950</b> She graduated from Allen High School for Girls as her class’s valedictorian, then began studying at The Juilliard School, New York.
              <br><br>
              <b>1951</b> She applied to, and was rejected from, Philadelphia’s prestigious Curtis Institute of Music. For the rest of her life, she suspected that her application had been denied because of racial prejudice.
              <br><br>
              <b>1954</b> To pay for piano lessons, and earn money to support her family, she ended up getting a job at a bar in Atlantic City, where she was told she would need to sing, or lose her job, so she accepted as she needed the money. Not wanting her mother to know she was playing ‘the devil’s music’ in bars, she became known as Nina Simone.<br><br>
              <b>1961</b> Nina married New York police detective, Andrew Stroud, and a year later gave birth to their daughter, Lisa Simone. Her new husband also became her manager, however the relationship was physically and mentally abusive.
              <br><br>
              <b>1964</b> Nina released her first civil rights song <i>'Mississippi Goddam'</i>. Written in response to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, where four black girls were killed by the Ku Klux Klan. It was banned in several southern states and boxes of promotional singles sent to radio stations around the country were returned with each record broken in half.
              <br><br>
              <b>1974</b> She left America, which she referred to as the ‘United Snakes of America’ to live in Liberia, where she was happiest.
              <br><br>
              <b>1984</b> She recorded the album <i>‘Live at Ronnie Scott’s’</i> at the Jazz Club in London, where she regularly performed.

              <br><br>
<b>2003</b> Just days before her death, the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia
awarded her an honorary degree.

              <br><br>
              <b>2003</b> She died in her sleep, after suffering from breast cancer for several years.
